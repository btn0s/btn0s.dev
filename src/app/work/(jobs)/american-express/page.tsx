        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          American Express is a Fortune 100 financial services company serving
          over 100 million cardmembers. Their customer care platform processes
          millions of interactions daily through mobile, web, and voice
          channels.
        </p>

        <p>
          I joined the AskAmex organization during a critical growth period,
          leading a team of engineers and contractors to modernize their
          customer service platform. Working closely with product and design
          teams, we balanced delivering new features with establishing better
          development practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          My favorite contribution was TimeMachine â€” a bridge system I designed
          that became the foundation for our modernization efforts. What started
          as an experimental solution grew into a critical piece of
          infrastructure, enabling teams across the organization to confidently
          build and ship new features.
        </p>
