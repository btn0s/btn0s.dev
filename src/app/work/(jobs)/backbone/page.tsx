        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Backbone is revolutionizing mobile gaming with premium controllers and
          seamless software experiences. Our products are sold worldwide, and we
          reached #1 on the App Store during Christmas 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
          I joined Backbone as the second engineer on the web team, where I
          architected key systems that helped scale the company from startup to
          global brand.
        </p>

        <p>
          After building a successful Figma plugin that transformed our design
          workflow, I was given the opportunity to found and lead Backbone Labs
          â€” the company's first Design Engineering team. The Labs team focuses
          on rapid validation and de-risking of early ideas, improving internal
          developer experience, and delivering end-to-end projects
          independently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under my leadership, Labs has become integral to Backbone's product
          development process, streamlining workflows between design and
          engineering while shipping impactful projects that drive business
          value.
        </p>
