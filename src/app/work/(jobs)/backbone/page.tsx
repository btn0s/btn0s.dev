        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Backbone is revolutionizing mobile gaming with premium controllers and
          seamless software experiences. Our products are sold worldwide, and we
          reached #1 on the App Store during Christmas 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
          I joined Backbone as the second engineer on the web team, where I
          architected key systems that helped scale the company from startup to
          global brand. Working with Next.js and headless Shopify, we built a
          platform that now serves customers worldwide.
        </p>

        <p>
          My favorite contribution started as an experiment: a Figma plugin to
          help our design team work more efficiently. After reducing asset
          management time by 80%, this led to founding Backbone Labs â€” the
          company's first Design Engineering team. We focus on rapid validation,
          internal tooling, and shipping end-to-end projects independently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under my leadership, Labs has become integral to Backbone's product
          development process, streamlining workflows between design and
          engineering while shipping impactful projects that drive business
          value.
        </p>
