## American Express

American Express is a global financial services company providing world-class credit cards, charge cards, and travel services to consumers and businesses worldwide.

I joined the team to help build travel concierge capabilities into the existing AskAmex platform, an internal tool used by customer care professionals (CCPs) to manage incoming chats from the Amex mobile apps.

### Highlights

- Led a team of 4 engineers working on the core AskAmex platform.
- Architected and built a system that allowed us to build a new React app on top of the existing AskAmex platform, built on Angular 1.x.
- Implemented new travel concierge features that enabled us to onboard 300+ travel CCPs and enter a new market.
- Launched web chat capabilities that allowed CCPs to chat with customers on the web, increasing customer satisfaction by 20%.
