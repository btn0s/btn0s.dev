## American Express

American Express ("Amex") is a global financial services company providing world-class credit cards, charge cards, and travel services to consumers and businesses worldwide.

I joined the AskAmex org to help modernize and expand the capabilities of the internal "AGT" tool, used by customer care professionals (CCPs) to manage incoming chats from the Amex mobile apps.

I led a team of engineers across multiple initiatives, including building new travel concierge features, launching web chat capabilities, and modernizing and hardening the core AskAmex platform.

### Highlights

- Architected and built a bidirectional "bridge" system that allowed us to build a new React app on top of the existing AskAmex platform, built on Angular 1.x.
- Used my "bridge" system to implement new travel concierge features that enabled us to onboard 300+ travel CCPs and enter a new market.
- Launched web chat capabilities that allowed CCPs to chat with customers on the web, increasing surface area for customer interactions.
