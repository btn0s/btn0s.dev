## Overview

Backbone is a market leader in the handheld gaming space, and has pioneered an entirely new class of gaming experiences with our seamless software experience. We were #1 on the app store on Christmas 2023, and are sold worldwide.

I joined Backbone as the 2nd engineer on the web team and led multiple initiatives that helped launch Backbone into the global market, I then later transitioned into a design engineering role where I built a program from the ground up.

### Highlights

- Built a Figma plugin for designers that reduces asset management friction and became a core part of their daily workflow.
- Led the development of custom product experiences for brand partnerships like [Playstation](https://www.playbackbone.com/playstation), [Kojima](https://playbackbone.com/blog/death-stranding-limited-edition-controller/) and [Post Malone](https://www.playbackbone.com/post-malone).
- Led the development of hundreds of game detail pages that increased organic traffic by 30%.
- Designed and built a custom shopping cart that increased AOV by 20%.
