# Overview

I led front-end development in ecommerce on the Backbone web store, supporting millions of sales at a global scale.
I then moved to the design team as the first design engineer, where I established the design engineering program.

## Impact

- Built a Figma plugin for designers that reduces asset management friction and became a core part of their daily workflow.
- Led the development of custom product experiences for brand partnerships like [Playstation](https://www.playbackbone.com/playstation), [Kojima](https://playbackbone.com/blog/death-stranding-limited-edition-controller/) and [Post Malone](https://www.playbackbone.com/post-malone).
- Led the development of hundreds of game detail pages that increased organic traffic by 30%.
- Designed and built a custom shopping cart that increased AOV by 20%.
