# Progressive blur

This was just a quick study on combining a blurred `backdrop-filter` with a gradient `mask-image` to create a progressive blur effect.
Scroll the card below to see the effect.

<ProgressiveBlur />

## Notes

- This technique will not work if the blur+mask are applied on an element with a parent that has a hidden overflow.
