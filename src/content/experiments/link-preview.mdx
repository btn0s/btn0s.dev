# External link previews on hover

A simple link preview component I designed for this site.

The idea here is to provide a simple way that visitors could access rich link previews in an elegant way, so they could see what certain links are about without having to leave the page.

I use this component on the homepage of this site for my current projects.

<small className={"lg:hidden"}>
  _Note: If you're viewing this on a mobile device, I've included a gif of the
  component in action below since there's no way to hover. Be sure to check it
  out on a desktop device!_
</small>

<img src={linkPreviewImg.src} className={"mb-8 mt-12 lg:hidden"} />

<div className={"hidden lg:block"}>
  <Experiment>
    <ExperimentContainer>
      <div className="text-white">
        <ExternalLinkWithPreview href="https://thinkhuman.co/" align={"center"}>
          https://thinkhuman.co
        </ExternalLinkWithPreview>
      </div>
      <div className={"opacity-50"}>hover on the link to see the preview</div>
    </ExperimentContainer>
  </Experiment>
</div>

### Tech stack

This component was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), it uses [`@shadcn/ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/) under the hood
and [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations.
