# External link previews on hover

A simple link preview component I designed so that visitors could access rich link previews in an elegant way, so they could see what certain links are about without having to leave the page.

<small className={"lg:hidden"}>
  _Note: This interaction detail is only visible on desktop, so be sure to come
  back and check it out._
</small>

<img src={linkPreviewImg.src} className={"mb-8 mt-12 lg:hidden"} />

<div className={"hidden lg:block"}>
  <Experiment>
    <ExperimentContainer>
      <div className="text-white">
        <ExternalLinkWithPreview href="https://thinkhuman.co/" align={"center"}>
          https://thinkhuman.co
        </ExternalLinkWithPreview>
      </div>
      <div className={"opacity-50"}>hover on the link to see the preview</div>
    </ExperimentContainer>
  </Experiment>
</div>

### Tech stack
