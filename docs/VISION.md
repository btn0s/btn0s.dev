## **Purpose of This Document**  
This document serves as a north star for my portfolio’s development. It outlines:  
- The intent behind my portfolio and what it needs to communicate.  
- The types of roles I want it to support.  
- The key content and structure needed to make it effective.  
- How to balance my design engineering identity with frontend engineering viability.  
- How to maintain a **living, evolving portfolio** that reflects both **career goals and active experimentation.**  

This is a living document that will evolve as I refine my work and direction.

## **Portfolio Intent & Vision**  
I am a systems-oriented design engineer specializing in prototyping, frontend architecture, and UX innovation. My work blends engineering, interaction design, and product thinking to create seamless, high-impact experiences.  

This portfolio should:  
- Clearly articulate my unique approach to bridging design and engineering.  
- Showcase real projects, experiments, and case studies that highlight my problem-solving skills.  
- Support multiple career pathways (design engineering, frontend engineering, and R&D roles).  
- Feel alive, evolving, and reflective of my thought process.  
- Make it undeniable that I belong in top-tier product teams.  
- Act as both a **career asset for hiring** and a **personal R&D space** for my work in design, AI, and interaction paradigms.

## **Target Roles & How the Portfolio Needs to Work for Them**  
This portfolio needs to position me effectively for three types of roles:  

### **Design Engineer (Primary Focus)**  
**Role Focus:** Bridging the gap between design and engineering, building tools, prototyping, and creating seamless experiences.  
**Target Companies:** Figma, Notion, Vercel, Apple Human Interface, Stripe, OpenAI, Google ATAP, R&D teams.  
**Portfolio Needs:**  
- Showcase deep prototyping work and UX problem-solving.  
- Highlight work that improves design and development workflows.  
- Demonstrate systems thinking through case studies.  
- Prove strong frontend and engineering capabilities.  

### **Frontend Engineer (Secondary, as a Fallback)**  
**Role Focus:** Engineering highly-performant, scalable UIs with a strong UX focus.  
**Target Companies:** Vercel, Shopify, Meta, Stripe, Linear, other product-focused organizations.  
**Portfolio Needs:**  
- Make frontend work clear and well-documented.  
- Highlight React, TypeScript, performance optimization, and system architecture.  
- Ensure technical case studies are strong and explain trade-offs.  
- Avoid making the portfolio feel too design-focused for engineering roles.  

### **R&D / Prototyping Engineer (Long-Term Interest)**  
**Role Focus:** Exploring new interaction paradigms, pushing AI-driven interfaces, building experimental prototypes.  
**Target Companies:** OpenAI, Google ATAP, Apple, DeepMind, emerging AI/game interaction startups.  
**Portfolio Needs:**  
- Demonstrate cutting-edge experiments (AI, interaction design, node-based scripting).  
- Show thought leadership in UX for emerging technologies.  
- Make it feel more like an exploration lab, not just a portfolio.

## **Portfolio Content Plan**  

### **Case Studies (3-5 Deep Dives)**  
Each case study should follow this structure:  
- The Problem → What was the challenge?  
- My Approach → How did I think about solving it?  
- Technical and Design Trade-offs → What decisions were made?  
- Outcome and Impact → What changed as a result?  

#### **Confirmed Case Studies:**  
- Backbone Labs Prototyping & Tooling – How I built internal tools to streamline workflows and speed up development.  
- Game Discovery & SEO System at Backbone – How I built a scalable, automated SEO landing page system.  
- Figma Plugin to Reduce Design Handoff Time – The tool that cut handoff time by 80%.  
- AI-Powered Game Bots (Future) – How I’m experimenting with training AI-driven bots for gaming.  
- Strella IDE (Future) – My exploration into node-based scripting for software designers.

### **Lab (Living Workshop for Experiments & Prototypes)**  
This section serves as a **living, evolving space** for high-impact experiments and ongoing projects. Instead of static showcases, it should **track project progress dynamically**, allowing visitors to see updates over time. Each project will be categorized based on its current stage:

- **In-Progress** → Actively being built, undergoing iteration.  
- **Needs Refinement** → Functional but needs further polish or validation.  
- **Explorations** → Early-stage concepts, research, and technical experiments.  

Ideas to include:  
- AI-driven interactions (game bots, UX experiments with LLMs).  
- Front-end performance optimizations (progressive blur, motion optimizations).  
- Rethinking IDE workflows (early Strella prototypes).  
- New interaction patterns for web applications.  

This section should **feel like an active space**, encouraging iteration and learning while showcasing the depth of my thought process and technical work.  

---

### **Portfolio Structure & UX**  
- **Homepage** → Should immediately define who I am and what I do.  
  - A concise hero statement (e.g., "I design and build systems that shape how people interact with technology.")  
  - Clear navigation for case studies, experiments, about, and contact.  
  - Featured projects that showcase my best work immediately.  

- **Work Page** → 
  - Displays **case studies first**, ensuring impactful projects are prioritized.  
  - Work history timeline is placed in an **aside/card layout**, showing only recent roles.  
  - Includes a **“View Full Resume”** link leading to `/resume`.  

- **Lab** → A more fluid, evolving section for experiments and prototypes.  

- **Resume Page (`/resume`)** →  
  - Contains the **full resume content** with a **clear download link**.  
  - Could include **a short summary at the top** before listing details.  

- **About Page (`/about`)** →  
  - Provides a deeper **personal narrative**, explaining **who I am, what I value, and how I approach work**.  
  - Helps reinforce my identity as a **systems-oriented design engineer** and my long-term career vision.

## **Final Thought: This Portfolio Needs to Make Me Undeniable.**  
This isn’t just a portfolio—it’s a proof of work for my approach to design engineering. It should get me hired at top-tier product and R&D teams while keeping options open for frontend roles.  

This document will evolve, but for now, this is my guiding vision.
